# **Distributed Systems Labâ€”Phase 1**

This directory contains the code for the socket lab.

## **Server.py**

represents the server, which is built via the socket library.
it will continuously listen for connections and serve the client,
in this case it's printing whatever the client sends-.


## **Client.py**

represents the client, which is built via the socket library.
it will connect to the server and send a message.

## **Testing the code**

you need two terminals to run the code. 
One terminal runs the server via: python server.py
and the other terminal runs the client via: python client.py

## **Output**
Client terminal:
